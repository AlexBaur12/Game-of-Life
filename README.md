# Game-of-Life

In this java project, I wrote a Game of Life program that follows the standard rules for living, dying, repopulating, etc.I implemented a JavaFX GUI in order to nicely visualize the Game of Life take place!

As of now, the user must click on the "Iterate" button in order for the next state to appear. I plan to add another button that will allow the state to iterate automatically.
